# Task-Manager-Symfony
A basic Task Manager App using CRUD operations.
This was my first time using the Symfony framework. I'm sure there are better ways of configuring some of the CRUD operations, but all basic functionality works well.

## Usage
Users can add tasks to be completed. 
Tasks can then be marked as incomplete, in progress, or complete. Status of the task will be indicated by a green font.
Tasks can be edited or deleted.

## Download
Users will have to configure their own DB.
